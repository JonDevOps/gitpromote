====================================================================
<b>gitpromote</b> is a social utility for github users to promote their projects to more people like you and me.

One can promote their project on <b>gitpromote</b> when they are in need of a helping hand to add any new feature,debug the code or help more people gain with the project. This would be highly helpful to the github users with less followers or newbies.


<b>gitpromote</b> is currently in it's development stage. If you would like to speak to me more abut this project mail me. :D
