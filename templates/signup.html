	<h3>How gitpromote works:</h3>
	<p>1. <b>gitpromote</b> takes information about your public repositories from github and creates your profile.</p>
	<p>2. Every gitpromote user initially gets 200 points as a token of appreciation.</p>
	<p>3. A user can promote his repository to any number of people he/she wants with the cost of points which makes your repository reach more people.</p>
	<p>4. gitpromote algorithm works in such a way that it promotes the repository to the people who have got some good amount of contributions on github in the language of the repository you are promoting.</p>
	<p>5. By promoting your repository on gipromote, users like you gain the sight of your repository so that you'll have the right people to add new features and to improve the code.</p> 
	<b>So join the growing community of open source users to help others thereby helping yourself ;)</b>
